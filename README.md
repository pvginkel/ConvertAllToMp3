## Introduction

Say you often need to convert `.WAV` files to `.MP3` files, e.g. because you
have an audio recorder that does not create `.MP3` files, this application
can help you out.

## Usage

When you start the **Convert All to MP3** application, you're presented with
the following dialog:

![Create shortcut](https://github.com/pvginkel/ConvertAllToMp3/raw/master/Support/Create%20shortcut.png)

In this dialog, you need to enter the following information:

* **Directory to convert**: Select the directory you want to search for `.WAV` files;
* **After conversion completes**: Select the action to perform after conversion completes.
  Here you can choose to either send the `.WAV` files to the recycle bin or delete them
  permanently. Alternatively, if you leave this as **Ask**, the application will ask
  you what to do after it completes conversion of the files;
* **Quality of MP3 files**: Select the quality of the `.MP3` files to create;
* **Exclude patterns**: If you need certain files or directories to be excluded from
  conversion, you can add patterns here to match those files or directories.

After you click **Create shortcut**, you're presented with a save dialog to store a shortcut
somewhere. You can e.g. create this shortcut on your desktop. Then, when you click this shortcut,
the **Convert All to MP3** application will be started with your selected presets.
